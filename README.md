Step 2: Create the YAML File Create a YAML file named students.yaml. 
This file will contain information about students, including their names, ages, majors, and GPAs. Here’s an example structure

Step 3: Write the Python Application Create a new Python file named app.py. This script will read the data from the YAML file, allow users to view all students, and filter students by GPA. Here’s the complete code with explanations

Conclusion - This application serves as a basic example of how to read data from a YAML file and utilize it within a Python program. You can expand upon this foundation by adding more features, such as sorting, updating student information, or saving changes back to the YAML file.
